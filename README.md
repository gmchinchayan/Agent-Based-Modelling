# Agent-Based-Modelling
from DSTI Course of Pr. Georgiy Bobashev - S21

Taget Group: For Data scientists learning the tools available for studying human behaviour and social interactions, making estimates of risks, and understanding qualitative relationships. 

Course Objectives:
The course will provide an overview of statistical models, Markov models, system dynamics models, and agent-based models. The course will then describe the main components and main steps in agent-based modelling. Laboratory part of the course will focus on actual building of an ABM. It will involve individual and team exercises. We will discuss approaches to model validation so that they are "trustable".


Assessment:
Usage of Netlogo Software for ABM Models as the assessment for this course.

ABM Model of Ocean Plastic Pollution present in fishes:

This is an ABM model that explains the ocean plastic pollution problem that is present in the fishing population that ends up in the plates of our foods for consumption.
Fish in the North Pacific ingest 12,000 to 24,000 tons of plastic each year, which can cause intestinal injury and death and transfers plastic up the food chain to bigger fish, marine mammals and human seafood eaters. A recent study found that a quarter of fish at markets in California contained plastic in their guts, mostly in the form of plastic microfibers.
