# Agent-Based-Modelling
from DSTI Course of Pr. Georgiy Bobashev - S21

Taget Group: For Data scientists learning the tools available for studying human behaviour and social interactions, making estimates of risks, and understanding qualitative relationships. 

Course Objectives:
The course will provide an overview of statistical models, Markov models, system dynamics models, and agent-based models. The course will then describe the main components and main steps in agent-based modelling. Laboratory part of the course will focus on actual building of an ABM. It will involve individual and team exercises. We will discuss approaches to model validation so that they are "trustable".


Assessment:
Usage of Netlogo Software for ABM Models as the assessment for this course.
